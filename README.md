# A-reinforced-final-belief-divergence-for-mass-functions-and-its-application-in-target-recognition
We propose a novel reinforced final belief divergence (RFBD) measure to solve the conflicting problem in mass functions from the perspective of divergence measurement. We combine belief entropy with RFBD and propose a novel multi-sensor data fusion approach, then achieve target recognition in UCI datasets.
